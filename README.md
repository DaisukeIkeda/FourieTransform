# Introduction
I've developed this app based on experience of my class for
juniors or seniors in Physics Department, Kyushu University,
aiming that I'd like to deliver basic ideas of Fourier Transformation.

Fourier Transformation or Fourier Series are written by mathematical notations,
such as integrals, infinite series, trig functions,
which are difficult to understand for kids.
But, we experience  phenomena in our daily lives, closely related to Fourier Transformation,  such as rainbows. 
Therefore, once we can understand basic ideas, I expect we can create interesting
science lessons for kids.

# Install and How to use
0. Put downloaded files somewhere under a Web server and access to the corresponding URL, using a browser of a smart-phone, tablet, or PC. Or you can use [App on a server at Kyushu Univ.](http://ikeike.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/fourier.html).
1. Figure out a shape of "Source", using ▲ and ▼ buttons.
2. Pushing "Calculate!" button, you can see the number (co-efficient) of 4 basic blocks (base vectors), where these basic blocks are (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1, -1), (1, -1, -1, 1), and (1, -1, 1, -1). For example, when the number of the 1st basic block is 2, then the height of the first four blocks of "4 Basic Blocks" are 2.
3. Pushing "Composite" button, it computes the sum of 4 basic blocks and displays the result at "Received". In this computation, only checked basic blocks are used. If all basic blocks are checked, "Received" are the same as "Source".
4. If there are unchecked basic blocks, "Received" and "Source" are not the same, and the difference is displayed at "distance". The more basic blocks you use, the more similar "Received" you get.
